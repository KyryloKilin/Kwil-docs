### Supported Arithmetic Operators
|Operator|	Description |	Example |
|:-------:|:------------:|:------------:|
|+ (Addition)|	Adds values on either side of the operator|	a + b will give 30|
|- (Subtraction)|	Subtracts the right hand operand from the left hand operand|	a - b will give -10|
|* (Multiplication)|	Multiplies values on either side of the operator|	a * b will give 200|
|/ (Division)|	Divides the left hand operand by the right hand operand|	b / a will give 2
|% (Modulus)|	Divides the left hand operand by the right hand operand and returns the remainder|	b % a will give 0|

### Supported Comparison Operator
|Operator|	Description |	Example |
|:-------:|:------------:|:------------:|
| == | Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not, if yes then the condition becomes true. | (a == b) is not true. |
| = | Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not, if yes then the condition becomes true. | (a = b) is not true. |
| != | Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not, if the values are not equal, then the condition becomes true. | (a != b) is true. |
| < > |	Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not, if the values are not equal, then the condition becomes true. | (a < > b) is true. |
| > | Checks if the values of the left operand is greater than the value of the right operand, if yes then the condition becomes true. | (a > b) is not true. |
| < | Checks if the values of the left operand is less than the value of the right operand, if yes then the condition becomes true. | (a < b) is true. |
| >= | Checks if the value of the left operand is greater than or equal to the value of the right operand, if yes then the condition becomes true. | (a >= b) is not true. |
| <= | Checks if the value of the left operand is less than or equal to the value of the right operand, if yes then the condition becomes true. | (a <= b) is true. |
| !< | Checks if the value of the left operand is not less than the value of the right operand, if yes then the condition becomes true. | (a !< b) is false. |
| !> | Checks if the value of the left operand is not greater than the value of the right operand, if yes then the condition becomes true. | (a !> b) is true. |

### Supported Logical Operators
|Operator|Description|
|:--------:|:----------:|
| AND | The AND operator allows the existence of multiple conditions in an SQL statement's WHERE clause. |
| OR | The OR operator is used to combine multiple conditions in an SQL statement's WHERE clause. |
