[Extensions](../extensions/introduction.mdx) can be run as separate processes that contain arbitrary business logic.  The Kwil daemon interacts with extensions over a
predefined [gRPC interface](<https://github.com/kwilteam/kwil-extensions/blob/main/proto/extension.proto>). Any gRPC server (written in any language) that implements this
interface can be run as a Kwil extension.

While extensions can be run as distributed infrastructure, **it is recommended to run them as containerized sidecars**. Running them as sidecars helps prevent
a lot of transient errors that can occur when running them as distributed infrastructure.  Containerization forces them to run with sandboxed resources, preventing
them from crashing the daemon (which can cause database corruption).

## Quickstart

The quickest way to run an extension is to use the Kwil [extension Docker Compose template](<https://github.com/kwilteam/extension-deployment-template>).
This template utilizes docker-compose to bring up the containers in the correct order.
It also contains the simplest configuration possible for running a local Kwil daemon.
