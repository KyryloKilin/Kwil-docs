This page contains a step-by-step guide for creating and using your first Kwil extension.  It will walk through the following steps:

1. Creating a valid Kwil Extension
2. Creating a Docker Image for the Extension
3. Using Docker Compose to run the extension with Kwil

**You will need [Docker](<https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/>) installed to complete this guide.**

## Creating a valid Kwil Extension

Kwil currently supports libraries for building extensions in both TypeScript/JavaScript and Golang.

We will use either of these libraries to create a gRPC server that can be used as a Kwil extension.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="typescript" label="TypeScript / JavaScript" default>

To build an extension server in TypeScript/JavaScript, we will be referencing the example found [here](./packages/javascript.mdx).

### Initalize Repository

Create a new repository and install the `kwil-extensions` package:

```bash
npm init -y
npm install kwil-extensions
npm install -D ts-node
```

### Implementing the Extension

To create a valid extension server:

1. Create a file called `index.js` or `index.ts`
2. Paste the example code from the [JavaScript Extension Example](./packages/js-ts#example-of-building-an-extenstion) into the file, or write your own extension.

To test that it is working properly, run:

```bash
ts-node index.ts
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="golang" label="Golang">

To build an extension server in Golang, we will be referencing the example found [here](./packages/golang.mdx)

### Creating the go.mod

Create a new repository and run the following command to create a new go.mod file:

```bash
go mod init github.com/<your_github_username>/<repository_name>
```
    
### Implementing the Extension

To create a valid extension server:

1. Create a file called `main.go`
2. Paste the example code from the [Golang Extension Example](./packages/golang.mdx#example-of-building-an-extension) into the file, or write your own extension.

To test that it is working properly, run:

```bash
go run main.go
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Creating a Docker Image

To create a Docker image for your extension, you will need to create a Dockerfile in the root of your repository.  This process will be slightly different
depending on whether you are using TypeScript/JavaScript or Golang.

In the root directory of your application, create a file called `Dockerfile` and paste the following:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="typescript" label="TypeScript / JavaScript" default>

```dockerfile title="Dockerfile"
# First stage: build the application
FROM node:14

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the source from the current directory to the working directory inside the container
COPY . .

# Build the application
RUN npm run build

# Expose port
EXPOSE 50051

# Command to run the application
CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"]
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="golang" label="Golang">

```dockerfile title="Dockerfile"
# First stage: build the application
FROM golang:1.20 AS builder

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy go mod and sum files
COPY go.mod go.sum ./

# Download all dependencies
RUN go mod download

# Copy the source from the current directory to the working directory inside the container
COPY . .

# Build the application
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build -a -installsuffix cgo -o main .

# Second stage: create the Docker image
FROM alpine:latest

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /root/

# Copy the binary from the first stage
COPY --from=builder /app/main .

# Expose port
EXPOSE 50051

# Command to run the application
CMD ["./main"]
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Now that you have a Dockerfile, you can build the image by running:

```bash
docker build -t my-extension-name .
```

## Running the Extension with Kwil using Docker Compose

Now that you have built your extension as a Docker image, you can run it with Kwil using Docker Compose.

To do this, we will be using the Kwil extension deployment template:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kwilteam/extension-deployment-template.git
```

Once you have cloned the repository, open the `docker-compose.yaml`.  Under `services:extensions-1:name`, replace "<your_image_here>" with the name of your Docker image:

```yaml title="docker-compose.yaml"
version: '3'
services:
  extension-1:
    image: <your_image_here>
    ports:
      - 50055:50051
    restart: on-failure
```

Now, simply use the Makefile to download Kwil and run both Kwil and your extension:

```bash
make download-and-run
```

**And that's it!**  You have successfully shipped your first Kwil extension alongside a Kwil database!

## Next Steps

To get started using the extension within Kuneiform, check out the [Kuneiform Guide for extensions](./kuneiform.mdx).  Or, if you're curious to learn how to build more
comlex extensions, check out the guide to the structure of extensions [here](./structure.mdx).
