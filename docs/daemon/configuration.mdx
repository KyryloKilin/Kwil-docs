Kwil utilizes environment variables for configuration.  The following environment variables are available:

- `PRIVATE_KEY`: This variable is used to store a cryptographic private key. If no private key is provided, a new one will be generated. A hexadecimal string should be provided, which will be converted to an ECDSA private key.

- `GRPC_LISTEN_ADDRESS`: This variable sets the address at which the gRPC server of the daemon listens for connections. The default value is :50051.

- `DEPOSITS_RECONNECTION_INTERVAL`: This variable specifies the interval (in seconds) at which the daemon tries to reconnect to the deposit source in case of disconnection. The default interval is 30 seconds.

- `DEPOSITS_BLOCK_CONFIRMATIONS`: This variable defines the number of block confirmations needed before a deposit is considered secure. The default value is 12.

- `DEPOSITS_CHAIN_CODE`: This variable sets the chain code for the deposits. The default value is 0.

- `DEPOSITS_CLIENT_CHAIN_RPC_URL`: This variable specifies the URL of the RPC for the client chain for deposits. The default URL is http://localhost:8545.

- `DEPOSITS_POOL_ADDRESS`: This variable stores the smart contract address of the deposit pool. The default address is 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000.

- `CHAIN_SYNCER_CHUNK_SIZE`: This variable sets the chunk size for the chain synchronizer. The default size is 100000.

- `SQLITE_FILE_PATH`: This variable sets the file path for all SQLite files. If not provided, it defaults to ~/.kwil/sqlite/ on Unix systems or /tmp/.kwil/sqlite/ if the home directory can't be determined.

- `LOG_LEVEL`: This variable sets the logging level of the daemon. The default level is info.

- `LOG_OUTPUT_PATHS`: This variable sets the output paths for logs. Multiple paths can be specified, separated by commas. By default, logs are written to stdout.

- `HTTP_LISTEN_ADDRESS`: This variable sets the address at which the HTTP server of the daemon listens for connections. The default value is :8080.

- `EXTENSION_ENDPOINTS`: This variable defines endpoints for extensions. Multiple endpoints can be specified, separated by commas.

- `WITHOUT_ACCOUNT_STORE`: This variable indicates whether the daemon should operate without the account store. It is a boolean value, defaulting to false.

- `WITHOUT_CHAIN_SYNCER`: This variable indicates whether the daemon should operate without the chain synchronizer. It is a boolean value, defaulting to false.

- `ARWEAVE_BUNDLR_URL`: This variable sets the endpoint for the Bundlr node that transactions should be written to.  If no value is provided, transactions will not be written to the Arweave network.
At this time, Kwil only supports paying Bundlr using `matic`.
