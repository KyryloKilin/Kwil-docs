## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the prerequisites outline in ["Getting Started"](../../getting-started.md).

## Introduction

In this example, we will be creating a very basic database and interacting with it using the JavaScript / TypeScript SDK.  This guide will show how to design and deploy a Kuneiform schema, how to insert data into the database, and how to read the data back.

### The Kuneiform IDE

This example is done using the [Kuneiform in-browser IDE](<https://ide.kwil.com>).  The IDE makes it very easy to build, deploy, and use databases on any Kwil network.

### Steps

This tutorial will be performed with the following steps:

- Depositing testnet funds (from the IDE)
- Deploying a Kuneiform schema (from the IDE)
- Writing and reading data from the schema (in JS/TS)
