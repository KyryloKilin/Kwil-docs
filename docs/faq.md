## Is there an incentivized testnet?

Currently, there is no incentivized Kwil testnet.  We will release information regarding public testnets in the future.

## Is there a Kwil token?

No.

## Why I am getting an "Account Not Found" error in the example?

Usually, an "Account Not Found" error meAns that the network has not detected that you have deposited any funds.  Ensure that you have claimed **and deposited** testnet tokens from the [faucet](<https://faucet.kwil.com>).

## Can I run a Kwil node?

Due to the rapidly changing nature of Kwil's software and the operations complexity it brings, we have made the ability to run Kwil nodes available to select design partners.  We will be releasing docs on this soon.  If you would like to become a design partner, ping us in our [Discord](<https://discord.com/invite/HzRPZ59Kay>).
