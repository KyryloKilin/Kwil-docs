Until the main Kwil DB repository is open source, the `kwild` command line 
application may be downloaded from the Kwil binary release repository.


## Download the `kwild` Executable

The Kwil daemon(`kwild`) will be packaged together with Kwil admin tool(`kwil-admin`) and Kwil cli(`kwil-cli`).
Download the [latest release](https://github.com/kwilteam/binary-releases/releases/tag/v0.6.0-beta)
for your platform.  Extract the `kwild` file from the archive and put it
into a folder that is in your `PATH` environment.

:::note
The binaries will be packaged as described above after the next major release.
The repository link may change soon.
:::

## Verify Installation

Open a terminal and run the following at the command prompt:

```bash
kwild --version
```

If installed correctly, it should display a message such as `kwild version 0.6.0-beta`.

Continue to the [Using Kwild page](./kwild) for running Kwil node.
