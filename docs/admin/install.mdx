Until the main Kwil DB repository is open source, the `kwil-admin` command line
application may be downloaded from the Kwil binary release repository.


## Download the `kwil-admin` Executable

The Kwil admin tool (`kwil-admin`) will be packaged together with Kwil daemon (`kwild`) and  Kwil cli (`kwil-cli`).
Download the [latest release](https://github.com/kwilteam/binary-releases/releases/tag/v0.6.0-beta)
for your platform.  Extract the `kwil-admin` file from the archive and put it
into a folder that is in your `PATH` environment.

:::note
The binaries will be packaged as described above after the next major release.
The repository link may change soon.

## Verify Installation

Open a terminal and run the following at the command prompt:

```bash
kwil-admin version
```

If installed correctly, it should display a message such as `kwil-admin version 0.6.0-beta`.

Continue to the [Usage](./usage) page for a description of all the available commands.
